# Cache Invalidation

To invalidate a cache on a Content Delivery Network (CDN) when a file on the server is updated, several methods can be employed depending on the CDN provider and the specific requirements of your application. Here are the general approaches:

## General Approaches to Cache Invalidation

1. **Set Appropriate Cache-Control Headers**:
   * Configure your server to send `Cache-Control` headers with appropriate `max-age` or `s-maxage` values. This way, the CDN will automatically refresh its cache after the specified duration when the content is updated.
2. **Manual Cache Purging**:
   * Most CDNs provide an interface or API to manually purge cached content. For example, in Google Cloud CDN, you can navigate to the **Cache invalidation** tab in the Cloud Console and specify paths or use wildcards to invalidate specific files or directories.
3. **Automated Cache Invalidation via API**:
   * Use the CDN's API to programmatically invalidate cache entries when files are updated. For instance, in Google Cloud, you can call the `invalidateCache` method via its REST API, specifying the URL paths of the resources that need to be invalidated.

Example API call:

```shellscript
POST https://compute.googleapis.com/compute/v1/projects/{project}/global/urlMaps/{urlMap}/invalidateCache
{
  "paths": ["/images/file.jpg"]
}
```

1. **Using Webhooks or Cloud Functions**:

   Set up webhooks or cloud functions that trigger cache invalidation whenever an asset is updated. For instance, if using Google Cloud Storage, you could trigger a Cloud Function that calls the cache invalidation API whenever a file upload event occurs[1](https://www.googlecloudcommunity.com/gc/Infrastructure-Compute-Storage/Cloud-CDN-cache-invalidation-on-asset-update/m-p/777973)[3](https://cloud.google.com/cdn/docs/invalidating-cached-content).
2. **Versioning Assets**:

   Another effective strategy is to implement versioning for your assets. By appending a version number or hash to the asset URLs (e.g., `/images/file.v2.jpg`), you can ensure that users always receive the latest version without needing to invalidate caches explicitly

## Specific CDN Examples

* **Google Cloud CDN**:

  Use the console or REST API for invalidation. You can invalidate single files or entire directories by specifying paths with wildcards
* **DigitalOcean Spaces CDN**:

  Navigate to the CDN settings and use the "Purge Cache" option to remove specific files or entire directories from the cache
* **Cloudinary**:

  Send an invalidation request by setting `invalidate=true` in your API calls when uploading or modifying assets

Implementing one or more of these strategies will help ensure that your users receive the most up-to-date content without unnecessary delays caused by stale cached data
