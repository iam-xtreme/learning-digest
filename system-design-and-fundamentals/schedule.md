## **Ongoing Tasks (Every Week)**
- **Mock Interviews**: Participate in mock system design or technical interviews with peers or mentors to simulate real interview conditions and get feedback.
- **Review & Adjust**: At the end of each week, assess what you've learned and adjust the following weekâ€™s plan based on your strengths and weaknesses.
- **Track Progress**: Keep track of daily progress through a learning journal or a simple tracker (Google Sheets, Notion).
