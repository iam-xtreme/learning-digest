## SAGA Protocol: A Distributed Transaction Pattern
The Saga protocol is a distributed transaction pattern used in microservices architecture to ensure atomicity and consistency across multiple services. Here's a brief overview:
### Problem: When multiple services interact with each other, it's challenging to ensure that all services complete their tasks successfully, without leaving the system in an inconsistent state.
### Solution: The Saga protocol uses a sequence of local transactions, coordinated by a Saga manager, to ensure that all services complete their tasks successfully or roll back to a consistent state if any service fails.
### Key Components:
 - Saga Manager: Orchestrates the Saga, managing the sequence of local transactions.
 - Local Transactions: Each service executes a local transaction, which can be a database update or a message send.
 - Compensating Transactions: Each local transaction has a corresponding compensating transaction, which reverses the effects of the original transaction.
     - Example Use Case:
         1. Order service creates an order and sends a message to the inventory service to reserve the product.
         2. Inventory service updates its stock and sends a message to the shipping service to prepare the order.
         3. Shipping service updates its shipping status and sends a message to the payment service to charge the customer.
         4. If any service fails, the Saga manager rolls back the transactions, restoring the system to a consistent state.
